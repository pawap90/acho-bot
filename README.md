# Features

## Manage your Twitch Chatbot from Notion
Add, update or delete commands in a Notion database. AchoBot will use the information from Notion to answer your viewers when they invoke a command.

## Assign Permissions to each Command
The database includes a `Permissions` column where you can specify who can invoke each command. Leave it empty and everyone will have access to it. 
The column accepts one or more of the following values: 
- Broadcaster
- Moderator
- Subscriber
- Viewer

### Specific user permissions
You can also create commands that can only be invoked by a single specific user. To do that use the value `usr:<username>`, for example: `usr:paulasantamaria`

## Command view
Navigate to /commands to get a list of every public command. Your viewers can use it to see the available commands.
Also, you can navigate to /commands?mode=image to get a ready-to-download image you can add to your Twitch panels.

## Scripted commands
You can specify the Type of command in the "Type" column. Available options are:
- Text
- Script

Text commands return a plain text response. E.g: "Welcome to the stream"
Scripted commands can implement some logic (JavaScript)  and receive parameters.

For example, imagine the following command `!say <text>`: 
```js
(context) => {
    const textToPrint = context.params.text;
    return `You said: ${textToPrint}`;
}
```

When a viewer invokes it: `!say hello`
Output: `You said: hello`

> This feature is new and still has some limitations and issues. Writing code in a Notion DB cell is not ideal ðŸ˜….

## Single account
The chatbot service will work only for the accounts and channels specified in the environment variables. 
If any other account tries to login using the chatbot authorization endpoints, it will get an authorization error. 

The service is not currently designed to handle multiple accounts. This is a limitation but it also makes the hosting and configuration of the service easier.

## Status view
Use the status view to see if your bot's Twitch account is correctly authorized. 
You can use this view in OBS to get real time feedback of your chatbot status (it auto-updates every minute).

# Quick start

## Dependencies
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

1. Setup your Notion Database. Generate it using the following Notion template: [[Template] AchoBot](https://familiar-freckle-76f.notion.site/350b171ebc30462fbdcb8391cb2f088a?v=0cf2e1a5f5bc476e827d2705e2bdc223)

> Press "Duplicate" to copy the template in your Notion. The template comes with a few sample commands; feel free to delete them and add your own.

2. Clone the repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/pawap90/acho-bot
```

3. Build the project
   
```
npm run build
```
> You can find the transpiled code in the `_dist` folder.

4. Make sure to setup all the [Environment variables](#environment-variables)

5. Run it
```
npm start
```
6. Open the site in your browser (E.g: http://localhost:5000 if you are running it locally) and press the link to login with your bot's Twitch account. This will give the application permissions to use the chat in your bot's behalf, so it can start answering to commands.

> Once you start streaming, if the service is running and you authorized the bot (step 6), the bot will login to the chat automatically. Give the bot's account moderator permissions so it can reply to commands without limitations. Type this in the chat: `/mod bot_username`

## Development

1. Clone the repo 
```
git clone https://github.com/pawap90/acho-bot
```

2. Install dependencies: Run the following command from the project's root folder:

```sh
npm install
```

3. Setup a `.env` file in the root as explaned in the [Environment variables](#environment-variables) section.

4. Start the local development server: 

```sh
npm run dev
```

## Environment variables
These are the environment variables required to run the project. Make sure set the values with your own data.

```
TWITCH_BOT_CLIENTID=<your-twitch-clientid>
TWITCH_BOT_CLIENTSECRET=<your-twitch-secret>
TWITCH_BOT_USERNAME=<your-bots-username>
TWITCH_CHANNELS=<your-twitch-channel>
TMI_DEBUG=true
TMI_LOGLEVEL=info
PORT=5000
TWITCH_BOT_REDIRECTURI=http://localhost:5000/api/twitch/auth/token
SESSION_SECRET=<a-random-value>
NOTION_APIKEY=<your-notion-api-key>
NOTION_DATABASEID=<your-notion-database-id>
NOTION_VERSION=2021-08-16
```
When running the project locally using `npm run dev` you should set the environment variables within a `.env` file in the root.
